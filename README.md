# Bronco-Banking-An-ATM-System
ATM Simulation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was done by former students of the California State Polytechnic University in Pomona(Cal Poly Pomona).
The students were: Mark Barros (Project Manager), Rosalinda Chamale, Anthony Zhang, Dexxer Medina, and Anthony Sepulveda.
They were all enrolled in Professor T. Damavandi's Object-Oriented Design and Programming course (CS 3560-03) during the Spring of 2021.
The project was worked on by the students during the COVID lockdown. The collaboration was performed via Discord and GitHub.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is called, "Bronco Banking: An ATM System", and is an ATM simulation.

The simulation allows for students to make the following transactions:

	* Deposit Money
	* Withdraw Money
	* Transfer Money

The simulation allows for bank operators to monitor the following:

	* The Customers
	* The Accounts
	* The Transactions

Additional incorporated functionality:	
  * The insertion of a bank card was simulated by allowing the user to click on an image of a card.
  * Should a student input the wrong password three times he/she will be locked out.
  * A bank operator has the power to freeze or unfreeze a student's account.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following was used to do the project:
	* Java (programming language)
	* JavaFX (set of JARs necessary for GUI projects)
	* Scene Builder (application for designing GUIs)
	* Eclipse IDE (environment for developing Java projects)
	* MySQL (relational management database system)
	* Git (version control system)
	* GitHub (Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code for project is located in src/application/bin.
The icons for the project are in src/application/icons.
The diagrams associated with the project are in Diagrams.
The slide presentation associated with the project is in Slide Presentation.
Screenshots of the running application, code base open in Eclipse, the database opened in MySQL,
and the application's windows open in Scene Builder are in their respective folders.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the application requires it be connected to a database, one must be setup and run on the local host:
     * A schema named "atm-db" must be created
     * The Username must be "root"
     * The Password must be "l9*K7&g6^D5%"

The following three files are used to build the database from scratch and are in ATM Database/:	 
     * "atm-db Workbench Model.mwb" (the schema structure)
     * "atm-db Builder SQL Script.sql" (SQL script for building the schema)
     * "Add All Records to atm-db SQL Script.sql" (SQL script for populating the schema with dummy data)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the project to function within Eclipse the following steps must be taken:
     * The e(fx)clipse plugin must be installed.
     * The mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar must be installed.
     * The JavaFX library must be installed.
	 * The location to the JavaFX jars must be added to the Classpath.
	 * The following VM argument must be added:
          --module-path "C:\your path\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
